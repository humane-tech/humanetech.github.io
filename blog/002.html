        Some time in early 2015 I set out to become the person I wanted to be.
        In the process, I learned a lot. My perspective, mind and life changed in ways I'm incredibly grateful for.
        This is an overview to the key resources of my transformation.
        On many of these ideas
      </p>


          <h2>Where to start?</h2>
          <p>
            The first thing I recommend, is to buy a journal.
            Whatever you learn, whatever inspires you, whatever goal you set, writing it down on paper is the first step to manifest it.

          <h2>It's all in your mind... or is it?</h2>
          <p>
            This is a book I just recently started to read.
            Spirituality isn't this vague, esoteric thing only hippies should care about.
            Spirituality is your quest to find answers to the questions about the core of your being.
            The truth is, you are not your mind.
            You are observing. The buddha's definition of enlightenment is "the end of all suffering".
            It's found beyond the mind, where true joy, connection and fulfillment are to be found.

            <b>The Power of NOW</b> by Eckart Tolle
          </a><br><br><br><br>

  <h2>The laws of success</h2>
  <p>
    Think and Grow Rich is <i>the</i> book on success.
    Reading it for the first time felt like finally having the user manual for life.
    <i>"The subconscious mind is the greatest power in the universe, that we have access to."</i>
    We can program it to work in our favor. We can choose, who we want to be.</p>
  <a class="book" href="https://amzn.to/2GWSLmO">Think And Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill</a><br><br><br>



  <h2>The first principle of how behavior works</h2>
  <p>
    1. Programming creates beliefs.<br>
    2. Beliefs create' attitudes.<br>
    3. Attitudes create feelings.<br>
    4. Feelings determine actions.<br>
    5. Actions create habits.<br>
    6. Habits create results.<br>
  <br>

  That's basically how the mind works.
  That means we can choose our destiny, by choosing inputs that create the programming we need to become the person we want to be.
  Only when we are aware of this law of life, we can really start the transformational process of becoming who we want to be.
  That also means, that we should not judge ourselves or anyone else for the person we are.
  We don't choose to be lazy, broke, overweight or addicted.
  But if we aren't aware of this law of life, we never get the opportunity to lay the foundation for who we really want to be.
  Just wanting something doesn't work if we don't align our beliefs, thoughts, actions and habits with the destiny we want to manifest.


  So the first step to change anything is to change our programming.
  This books does an exceptional job at helping with that.

  <h2>"Whereever you are, ego is too."</h2>
  <p>Social Media. Trips to Australia to find ourselves. The endless pursuit of finding our passion. Life, for my generation all about ourselves. Except, it isn't.
    Our sense of self is elevated, we are looking down on things - which is why we don't see, what's above. <br><br>
  To be somebody, or to do something. Which way will you go?
